# ALX_Simple_Quiz

This is a simple interactive quiz project created as part of the ALX Frontend Development learning experience.

## Project Description

The quiz is designed to test the user's basic knowledge through a multiple-choice question. The quiz uses HTML and CSS for structure and styling, and JavaScript to handle user interaction and feedback.

### Features

- A single quiz question: "What is 2 + 2?"
- Three answer choices using radio buttons
- A submit button that checks if the selected answer is correct
- Feedback displayed below the quiz based on the user's selection

## Files Included

- `index.html` – Contains the structure of the quiz
- `styles.css` – Styles the layout of the quiz
- `quiz.js` – Adds interactivity to the quiz (user answer checking and feedback)

## How It Works

1. The user selects one of the given answers.
2. Clicking the **Submit Answer** button runs the `checkAnswer()` function.
3. The function checks if the selected answer is correct (correct answer: "4").
4. It displays a message:
   -  "Correct! Well done." if the answer is right
   -  "That's incorrect. Try again!" if the answer is wrong
